What I have implemented

🖌️ Feedback: A lot of colours going on - do not like black. Improvement: I’ve simplified the color scheme, making it more cohesive and professional. The background is now a neutral tone that ensures the text and buttons stand out while avoiding the black color that was previously mentioned. The goal is a cleaner, more user-friendly interface. 🎨

📊 Feedback: Dashboard should be first in the menu options. Improvement: The dashboard is now the first item on the menu for quick access. This helps improve user navigation and aligns with common user interface patterns, where the dashboard serves as the main hub. 💡

📂 Feedback: Drop down menu for submit claim? Improvement: I’ve added dropdown menus for selecting various claim types, including Monthly Rate, Training Reimbursement, and Miscellaneous Expenses. This makes the submission process smoother by providing users with predefined options. 📑

🔍 Feedback: Empty fields should have placeholders. Improvement: All form fields now include descriptive placeholders, guiding users on what information is expected, e.g., "Enter Monthly Rate" or "Select Payment Method." This improves the usability of the form, especially for first-time users. 📝

🚮 Feedback: Clear buttons? Improvement: Clear buttons have been added next to each form to allow users to reset fields with ease if they make mistakes or need to start over. This enhances the overall user experience by offering more control over input. 🔄

✍️ Feedback: Can edit an approved claim? Improvement: I’ve added a feature that allows users to edit approved claims, making it more flexible in cases where details need updating after approval. ✏️

📋 Feedback: Menu option on top or side? Pick one place. Improvement: The menu is now consistently placed on the side, aligning with standard dashboard designs. This keeps navigation intuitive and eliminates confusion. 📑

📎 Feedback: Documents only submitted with claim. Improvement: I ensured that documents can only be submitted as part of a claim process, ensuring better organization of claims and related documents. 📎

🛠️ Feedback: Admin side? Improvement: The admin functionality is now in place, allowing administrators to manage claims, review submitted documents, and perform necessary approvals. This provides better control over the system. 🧑‍💼

🔐 Feedback: Login/register? Improvement: Although the login and registration functionality is not fully implemented yet, the system currently sends information to the database, ensuring user data is securely stored for future authentication. 🔒
